I use Anaconda which is faster then PIP(Anaconda 3.7.6 64bit version)
Download from here https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
You need at least 5 gb free space for installation of anaconda and other libraries
I prefer to use Pycharm as IDE (PyCharm Community Edition Project)
You can open Pycharm from the Anaconda Navigator
And I create virtual environment for PostgreSQL, I wrote steps below:
1- Open Anaconda Prompt
2-1) (Optional) conda update conda(If you don't have the latest version of Anaconda)
2-2) conda create -n postgres python=3.7.6 anaconda #It starts to create virtual environment
2-2.1) Press y and enter and It takes a while to create and install
3-) conda env list #lists of your Anaconda environments and you can see "postgres"
4-) conda activate postgres #With this command you switches to postgres envrionment
5-) conda install numpy
6-) conda install pandas
7-) conda install psycopg2 #This is the PostgreSQL library that I will use and this is most popular library
8-1)psycopg2 needs some other libraries so I got an error but thankfully anaconda finds those libraries and 
	it updated those files. This process takes around 15 minutes and It asks you for a conifmation y/n press y
8-2) create a new file and type this to check It is working or not:
try:
    import psycopg2
    print("working")
except(Exception):
    print("not working")
	or just type
import psycopg2
if It throws an error search on the Internet :)))
  

9-)Finally select the your environment as intrepeter in any IDE (Vscode, Pycharm, spyder, etc...)
